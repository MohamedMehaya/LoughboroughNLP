# NLP_Loughborough
In this coursework we were provided with two datasets and we were required to preprocess them, develop an LSI model and retrieve the top 10 most similar queries from the dataset, and to tune the LSI model. Further details are in the coursework specification.
You can find my solution to the five tasks in the notebooks provided.

The NLP project, was made using NLTK, BERT and GPT-3 Libraries
